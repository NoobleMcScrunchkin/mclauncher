WIP Custom Minecraft Launcher

Tragically lost most up to date version of this project when trying to push to GitHub due to some problems with GitHub Desktop and my own mistake.

Did support downloading all required libraries and having multiple instances, as well as downloading required files for modded versions of the game.
